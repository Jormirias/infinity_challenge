Challenge for Infinity Games

Code convention used: W3C standards

I changed the number titles of the levels, since they didn't match the ones in the level selection.

The solutions to the puzzles were hardcoded in the PlayScene. Given more time I would've liked to create a separate file for store the solutions.

I'd also like to invest more in the window size detection/adaptation. At the moment, the game only adapts when the page is loaded (either for mobile browser or desktop). Ideally, it would adapt each time the window size changes.
